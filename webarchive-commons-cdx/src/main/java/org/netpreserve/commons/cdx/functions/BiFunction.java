     * <p>
     * For the first invocation, the previous line will be null and the current line will be the
     * first line. For following iterations the previous line will be the line that was current line
     * in the last invocation until this method returns a non null result. When this method returns
     * a non null result, execution will continue with other registered BiFunctions until a final
     * non null result is returned and the iterator will return this as its next value. For the next
     * request for a value from the iterator, the chain of Bifunctions will be evaluated with the

     * <h3>Example</h3>
     * A simple deduplication filter could be implemented like this:
     * <pre>
     * public CdxRecord apply(CdxRecord previousLine, CdxRecord currentLine) {
     *     if (previousLine == null || !currentLine.equals(previousLine)) {
     *         return currentLine;
     *     } else {
     *         return null;
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * @param previousLine the last non null result for previous invocations of this method or null
     * if no such result exists.
     * @param currentLine the current line to be processed or null if there are no more lines.
     * @return the result of the computation. Might be null.
